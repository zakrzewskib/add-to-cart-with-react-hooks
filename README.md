### React hooks:
- `useState` - to manage state,
- `useEffect` - to make cart bump animation,
- `useContext` - to have access to cart context and pass offer info from src/components/Offers/Offer to src/components/Cart/Cart,
- `useReducer` - to manage more complicated cart context and its add and remove actions.

<em>Time: 2h</em>

### About CSS:
- It took more time than I assumed and I spend 1/3 of time on onHover 'modal', which caused me some problems.
- To make website responsive I used package react-responsive and useMediaQuery hook.

<em>Time: 6h</em>

### WebScraping:
- I wanted to try out webscraping with BeautifulSoup python library to get offers data from the website.
- Then I put the offers in sqlite database with plans to make an api to get them, but finally I exported database to json file from which I get the data.

<em>Time: 1h</em>
